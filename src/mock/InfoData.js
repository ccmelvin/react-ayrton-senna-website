  paragraphTwo:
    "True. First, it’s worth mentioning that it would be impossible to control a race car whose brakes had given out completely.

Senna ended up losing a few places and had to adapt to a new driving style.In the end, Senna managed to regain the lead and reached the checkered flag using only the rear brakes. He had to stop his car at the track’s first corner, close to the pit-lane entrance. After the race, the driver told what had happened, and the mechanics confirmed his front brake discs were cold, meaning the Brazilian really hadn’t used them.",
